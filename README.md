# reproduction_simulation

In this project I have simulated the behavior of creatures. In this project I have created random creatures with properties (which I will call genes in this ReadMe): size, reproduction, speed and life duration. 

The main goal is to see, which of these are the most important for a creature to survive. Every time a creature touches another creature (and both of them are fertile), they will get kids. The amount of kids is decided with the average reproduction of both of them. So for example: two creatures are old enough to be fertile, touch each other, and the reproduction properties are 4 and 2. They will get 3 kids. 

When the kids are born the parents will die and pass their genes with little mutations to their kids. This means that the kids will look a lot like their parents. The creatures will move at the speed they have in their genes and will die if they outlive their life-duration. This is the description for this project, hope you'll like it.
